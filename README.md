Hi!

I'm just learning how to use github, and this is my  profile!

I'm a maths graduate and a small business owner (www.instagram.com/theheatmerchant for all your trainers.)

I'm really excited to be on this graduate scheme and my goal is to become a software engineer by the end of it!

I just uploaded this using VS Code and the Apple Terminal , pretty proud of myself.

Hmmm, small change
